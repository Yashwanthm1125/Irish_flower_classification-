# Irish_flower_classification-
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements. Using classic machine learning algorithms, it demonstrates how supervised learning can be applied to solve a simple yet foundational classification problem in data science.

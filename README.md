# Irish_flower_classification-
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements. Using classic machine learning algorithms, it demonstrates how supervised learning can be applied to solve a simple yet foundational classification problem in data science.

 Features

Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn

Model training with Scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN)

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook workflow

 Dataset

The dataset used is the Iris Dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning — originally introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936. It contains 150 samples with four numerical features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

 Goal

To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features.

 Results

Achieved over 95% accuracy using the Random Forest classifier. Visualizations highlight clear separation between the species based on petal dimensions.

 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Deploying model using Streamlit or Flask

Adding interactive visualizations
